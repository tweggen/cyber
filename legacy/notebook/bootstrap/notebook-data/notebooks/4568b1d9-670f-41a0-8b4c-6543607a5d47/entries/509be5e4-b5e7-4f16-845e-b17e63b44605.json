  "content": "ENTROPY MODEL: Integration cost serves as the entropy measure. Zero cost = redundant. Low cost = natural extension. Medium cost = genuine learning. High cost = paradigm shift. Beyond threshold = orphaned (stored but not integrated, analogous to trauma/PTSD). The sum of integration costs IS the time arrow. Causality replaces timestamps as the fundamental ordering. Irreversible state change defines progression.",
