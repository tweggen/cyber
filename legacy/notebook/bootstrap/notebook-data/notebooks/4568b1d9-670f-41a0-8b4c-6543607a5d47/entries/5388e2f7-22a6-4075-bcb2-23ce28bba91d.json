  "content": "TASK: Create integration tests validating entropy/integration cost behavior.\n\nCONTEXT: Verify that integration costs match intuitive expectations for various entry patterns.\n\nTEST CASES:\n\n1. Consistent entries (expect LOW cost):\n   - Write entry about topic A\n   - Write another entry about topic A with same keywords\n   - Verify: low catalog_shift, entries_revised=0\n\n2. Contradictory entry (expect HIGH cost):\n   - Write entries establishing fact X\n   - Write entry contradicting X\n   - Verify: high catalog_shift or entries_revised > 0\n\n3. Unrelated entry (expect ORPHAN):\n   - Build up entries about topic A\n   - Write entry about completely unrelated topic B with no references\n   - Verify: orphan=true or very high catalog_shift\n\n4. Resolving entry (expect MEDIUM cost):\n   - Create entries with different perspectives\n   - Write entry that synthesizes/resolves them with references to both\n   - Verify: references work, moderate cost\n\n5. Reference healing:\n   - Write entries A and B that should be related but arent referenced\n   - Write entry C that references both\n   - Verify: catalog reorganizes to show connection\n\n6. Entropy accumulation:\n   - Track total entropy over many writes\n   - Verify: entropy increases monotonically\n   - Verify: high-cost entries contribute more\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- Rust integration tests in tests/entropy_validation.rs\n- Clear assertions with descriptive messages\n- Document expected vs actual behavior\n\nACCEPTANCE:\n- All test cases pass\n- Entropy behavior matches discussion.md theory\n- Clear documentation of what each test validates\n\nREFERENCES: See entropy model entry.",
