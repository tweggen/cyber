Setup:\n   - Create shared notebook\n   - Agent A and Agent B both have access\n\n2. Agent A writes initial knowledge:\n   - Entry about topic X\n   - Entry about topic Y referencing X\n\n3. Agent B browses and reads:\n   - Browse notebook, see As entries\n   - Read entry about X\n\n4. Agent B contributes:\n   - Write entry about topic Z referencing X\n   - Write entry with different perspective on Y\n\n5. Agent A observes and responds:\n   - Observe changes since last check\n   - See Bs new entries with integration costs\n   - Revise entry about Y incorporating Bs perspective\n\n6. Verify final state:\n   - Causal graph has cycles (Y references X, Z references X, revised Y references Bs entry)\n   - Integration costs are non-zero and meaningful\n   - Catalog reflects combined knowledge\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- Rust integration test in tests/two_agent_exchange.rs\n- Uses actual HTTP client against test server\n- Simulates two different author IDs\n\nACCEPTANCE:\n- Test passes end-to-end\n- Demonstrates cyclic references\n- Integration costs are computed\n- Clear test output showing the exchange\n\nREFERENCES: See discussion.md for philosophical foundation.",
