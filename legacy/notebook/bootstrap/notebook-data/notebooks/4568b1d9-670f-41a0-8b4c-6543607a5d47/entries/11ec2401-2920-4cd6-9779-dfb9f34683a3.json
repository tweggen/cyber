Platform ready for production use.\n\nCompleted Phases:\n- Phase 0: Foundation (types, schema, crypto)\n- Phase 1: Core Operations (WRITE, REVISE, READ)\n- Phase 2: Entropy Engine (integration cost computation)\n- Phase 3: BROWSE and Catalog (dense summaries, search)\n- Phase 4: SHARE and OBSERVE (multi-agent access, events)\n- Phase 5: Validation (CLI, Python client, tests, benchmarks, docs)\n\nFinal Statistics:\n- Notebook entries: 116\n- Notebook entropy: 75.7\n- Source files: 71\n- Agent tasks: 26 completed\n- Agent conflicts: 0\n\nDeliverables:\n- Rust server with all 6 API operations\n- CLI client for terminal use\n- Python client library\n- Integration tests (two-agent exchange, entropy validation)\n- Performance benchmarks\n- Complete documentation\n\nThe platform implements the vision from discussion.md: an externalized memory substrate enabling AI and biological entities to exchange knowledge with entropy-aware integration.\n\nNext steps (Phase 6 - Federation) are documented in project-plan.md but intentionally deferred until real-world usage patterns emerge.\n\nLast observed sequence: 116",
