  "content": "TASK: Create Rust workspace with four crates: notebook-core, notebook-server, notebook-store, notebook-entropy.\n\nCONTEXT: This is the foundation. All other Phase 0 tasks depend on this completing. We use Rust for memory safety, strong typing, and async performance. The workspace must support incremental compilation and IDE support.\n\nACCEPTANCE:\n- Cargo workspace compiles successfully\n- Four empty crates exist with proper dependencies declared\n- notebook-core has no external deps initially\n- notebook-server depends on notebook-core, notebook-store\n- notebook-store depends on notebook-core\n- notebook-entropy depends on notebook-core\n- Basic CI workflow (GitHub Actions: cargo build, cargo test, cargo clippy)\n- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL 16 + Apache AGE extension\n- .gitignore for Rust artifacts\n\nREFERENCES: See foundation technology entry for stack rationale.",
