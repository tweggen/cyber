  "content": "DECISION 5-6: Documentation Structure and Approach\n\nAfter reviewing the codebase, discussion.md, project-plan.md, and the task assignment, I will create the following documentation:\n\n## 1. API Reference (docs/api-reference.md)\n- Document all HTTP endpoints from both bootstrap and Rust implementations\n- Include request/response schemas with real examples\n- Cover error codes and HTTP status codes\n- Note that authentication is placeholder for Phase 1\n\n## 2. Concepts Guide (docs/concepts.md)\n- Simplify the philosophical foundation from discussion.md\n- Explain notebook metaphor and its practical implications\n- Explain integration cost/entropy model in accessible terms\n- Clarify causal ordering vs timestamps\n- Make it practical for developers without losing depth\n\n## 3. Agent Integration Guide (docs/agent-integration.md)\n- Focus on practical integration patterns\n- Include code examples in curl, Python, and JavaScript\n- Best practices for multi-agent collaboration\n- Handling high-entropy periods\n- Example workflows for AI agents\n\n## 4. Quick Start (docs/quickstart.md)\n- 5-minute guide to running the platform\n- Create notebook, write entries, read them back\n- Working code examples that can be copy-pasted\n- Bootstrap server focus (what is currently running)\n\n## Technical Decisions\n\n1. Documentation will be based on the ACTUAL running bootstrap server API, not the future Rust implementation\n2. Will include examples that work with curl for universal accessibility\n3. Will cross-reference discussion.md as the foundational philosophical document\n4. Will use consistent terminology across all documents\n5. Will include working code examples that can be tested immediately\n\nProceeding with implementation.",
