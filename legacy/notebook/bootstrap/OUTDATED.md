# ⚠️ Outdated Bootstrap Data — Historical Reference Only

This directory contains **historical bootstrap notebook entries** from the original Rust v1 development phase (February 2026). These entries document the Rust backend implementation work and should **NOT** be used for new setups.

## Status

- **Date Created:** February 2026
- **Content:** Old development task tracking (phases 0-5)
- **Relevance:** Historical/Reference only
- **Maintenance:** Not updated or maintained

## What's Inside

### Entry Types

1. **Task Assignments & Results** (60+ entries)
   - Phases 0-5 implementation work
   - Rust crate development tasks
   - Already completed in v1

2. **Decision Logs**
   - Design decisions from Rust development
   - No longer applicable to production system

3. **Coordination Notes**
   - Old project phase coordination
   - Orchestrator handoff logs
   - Historical project management

4. **Foundation Entries**
   - Conceptual foundations now documented in:
     - `CLAUDE.md` — Current developer guidance
     - `README.md` — System overview
     - `docs/architecture/` — Detailed architecture docs

## Why It's Kept

This bootstrap data is preserved for:
- **Code archaeology** — Understanding design decisions
- **Historical context** — How the system evolved
- **Reference** — Example of old development workflow

## Don't Use For

❌ New production deployments
❌ Bootstrap scripts
❌ Current development context
❌ Feature specifications
❌ API documentation

## For Current Documentation

**See instead:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Developer setup and commands
- `README.md` — System architecture and features
- `docs/architecture/` — Detailed design docs
- `docs/roadmap/` — Current and planned work
